As of now:

Logistic Regression Model: 0.9865 accuracy, 0.9831 MCC

Bert: 1.0 accuracy, 1.0 MCC

LSTM: 0.8789 accuracy, 0.8486 MCC

There's a new Bert model saved in drive./ Same model but trained again so maybe different? UPDATE: This will be true of LogReg as well.

LTSM should have trained but we mightve closed out of it on colab

LogReg also has a drive folder now.

OK SO IN SHORT:

The Colab code is more updated than the VSCode Colab code.

All 3 models have updated versions saved in drive.

LSTM and LogReg had their tests calculated during the Colab code, while BERT has its calculated in test_model.py.

I trained a new model of Bert and saved it in Drive from Colab. It was trained exactly the same way so I have no clue if its accuracy and whatnot will be the same. Probably is, just ran the code again. That version is in Drive, and not on the computer (the latter of which has its score listed on this file as of now).

As of 12/21/25 at 1 PM, the Colab code saved locally is the updated version. Haven't run it yet but should be good.
